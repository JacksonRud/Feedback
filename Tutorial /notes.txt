first i am going to review what i did yesterday
The first step was installing node js and express, we ended up having to use the sudo code to install express globally 
now we create a node test called john2 by typing in "express john2"
now i will change the location of john 2 with finder, I wish i had a better way to do this. 
now the next step is to edit the dependencies, this is done by changing the package.son file to add the dependencies we will use, it is very easy to make a mistake when entering the code. 
next we solidify what we did by directing the program to install the dependencies though terminal. this is done by entering "npm install"
i had trouble first going to the folder but then i realized that comp notes is a bad title because of the space so i renamed it COMPNOTES. 
then it was easy 
there were a lot of warnings but it seemed to work 
still in the john2 folder i enter the command mkdir data, i don't know why but apparently it does something to save mongo db
suddenly all my files in sublime disappeared but that was solved by reopening file 
in the john 2 folder i type in nom start and then open the localhost:3000 in my browser. 
okay now i am going to learn more about java script and stop the timer.
